### Categories

- **Description:** Manages operations related to categories, enabling retrieval of all categories, detailed information about a specific category, creation of new categories, updating existing categories, and deletion of categories.

### Locations

- **Description:** Manages operations related to locations, enabling retrieval of all locations, detailed information about a specific location, creation of new locations, updating existing locations, and deletion of locations.

### Rooms

- **Description:** Manages operations related to rooms, facilitating organization and manipulation of information about each room. Includes retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.

### Inventories

- **Description:** Manages the inventory of items or equipment, allowing retrieval of all items, detailed information about a specific item, creation of new items, updating existing items, and deletion of items.

### Usages

- **Description:** Tracks the usage history of items or equipment, providing information about when an item was used, by whom, and for what purpose. Allows retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion of usage records.

### Usage Histories

- **Description:** Tracks the usage history of items or equipment, offering information about when an item was used, by whom, and for what purpose. Supports retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion of usage history records.

### Repair Histories

## Example Usage

Developers can leverage the provided endpoints to integrate user authentication, manage employee and room information, categorize items, track repair and usage histories, and manage the inventory of items or equipment.

## Note to Developers

- Refer to the documentation for proper usage of each endpoint.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to sensitive data and operations.
- Follow the specified request and response formats for seamless integration.

## Important Considerations
